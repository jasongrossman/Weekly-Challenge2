                My name is Jason and I believe in doing things the right way. I have a passion for building and creating,
                with strategic thinking as my foundation. I like to think of new ideas, and put them into action. I have a 
                background in business, with professional experience in energy, retail, and consumer goods. Now I am 
                building up my capability in full stack development, in order to build in a digital world.
